    <h2>"VERSAILLES" IN LEICESTER SQUARE.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>Or, the New Ballet at the Empire, as it appears through
    Mr. Punch's Pince-nez.</i>)</h4>

    <p>TABLEAU I.&mdash;The Park at Versailles. "<i>Gardeners</i>,"
    according to the "Argument" supplied with programmes, "<i>are
    seen busily preparing for the arrival of King Louis the
    Fourteenth and his Court.</i>" If tickling the gravel gently
    with brooms, and depositing one petal a-piece in large baskets
    is "busily preparing," they <i>are</i>. The Gardeners, feeling
    that they have done a very fair afternoon's work, dance a
    <i>farandole</i> in <i>sabots</i>, after which Ladies and
    Cavaliers arrive and prepare to dance too; the Cavaliers select
    their partners by chasing them on tiptoe, the Ladies run
    backwards, and coyly slap their favourites' faces with
    bouquets. Here, according to Argument, "<i>refreshments are
    served by Pages</i>." Don't see any; these particular Pages
    seem to have been cut. Dance follows: the <i>Vicomte Raoul de
    Bragelonne</i> arrives, but stands apart, taking no part in the
    dance, and looking melancholy. Fancy he is wishing he had
    learnt dancing in his boyhood, or else waiting for the
    refreshments to be served. On referring to Argument, however,
    discover that "<i>his mind is occupied by thoughts of Louise de
    Lavallière, who was betrothed to him in her childhood.</i>"
    Stupid not to see this for oneself. So obvious. Enter
    <i>Louise</i>. Think <i>Raoul</i> informs her in pantomime that
    one of the bows on her dress has "come undone;" she rewards him
    for this act of politeness by taking the bow off and pinning it
    on his breast. <i>Raoul</i> not satisfied, pleads for another,
    to put on his hat. <i>Louise</i> refuses, can't ruin her new
    frock like that for <i>him</i>. Find I'm wrong again. Argument
    says, "<i>he implores her to fulfil the wish of his own and
    their parents' hearts by naming the nuptial day. Louise is
    confused, and bids him wait.</i>" He retires brokenhearted, in
    search of the refreshments, and the Cavaliers, with whom a very
    little dancing on gravel and a warm afternoon goes a long way,
    retire with him. The ladies, left alone, "<i>now freely express
    their opinions on the merits of their late companions</i>,"
    which seems natural enough. <i>Louise</i> dissents; doesn't see
    anything particularly rude in their conduct, "Cavaliers
    <i>are</i> like that&mdash;<i>will</i> rush off for
    refreshments alone after every dance and leave their partners."
    At least, that's how <i>I</i> understood her. Missed the point
    again. Argument informs me she has been answering, "<i>abruptly
    that the Sun (meaning the King) absorbs her whole soul, and
    that she has no thoughts to bestow on mere planets</i>." She
    said all that in a shake of the head and two shrugs, so
    "abruptly" is quite the right word. Other ladies annoyed with
    her, and show it by walking past and waggling their fingers in
    her face, which appears to depress <i>Louise</i> considerably.
    Then they go out, after the Cavaliers, or the refreshments.
    Meanwhile <i>Louis the Fourteenth</i> has entered at the back
    and overheard all. <i>He</i> knows what the shake and shrugs
    meant, and smiles and nods knowingly to himself. "Oh, I
    <i>am</i> an irresistible Monarch, <i>I</i> am!" he seems to be
    saying. "I'll follow this up." So he struts down with a fixed
    smile on his face, like the impudent young dog he is, and pats
    his chest passionately at her. <i>Louise</i> startled. "Don't
    go away," says <i>Louis</i> in pantomime. "I say, there's an
    arbour in that shrubbery,&mdash;let's go and sit in
    it&mdash;<i>do</i>!" <i>Louise</i> undecided; tries to excuse
    herself. "Earwiggy? not a bit of it!" <i>Louis</i> assures her
    (he wouldn't be so confident about it if he had seen his
    Gardeners at work); "<i>come</i> along!" <i>Louise</i> still
    timid; suggests spiders. <i>Louis</i> vows that no spider shall
    harm her while he lives to protect her, and draws her gently
    towards the shrubbery; he does this several times, but on each
    occasion her dread of insects returns, and she recoils
    shrinking. The King puts his arms round her to give her
    courage, and at this instant, <i>Raoul de Bragelonne</i>
    returns, sees the back of someone embracing the maiden who was
    betrothed to him in childhood, draws his sword&mdash;and
    recognises his Sovereign. "Whew!" his expression says plainly
    enough. "Now I <i>have</i> put my foot in it nicely!" He takes
    off his hat and apologises profusely; but <i>Louis</i> is
    indignant. What's the use of being a <i>Roi Soleil</i> if you
    can't ask a lady of your Court to sit in an arbour without
    being interrupted like this? He swells visibly, and intimates
    that he will pay <i>Raoul</i> out for this in various highly
    unpleasant ways. <i>Louise</i> kneels to him for pardon.
    <i>Louis</i> subsides gradually, but still shows the whites of
    his eyes; finally he tells <i>Raoul</i> to be off. <i>Raoul</i>
    is submissive&mdash;only wants to know where he's to <i>go</i>
    to. <i>Louis</i> points to Heaven, evidently regal politeness
    forbids him to indicate any other place. <i>Raoul</i> goes off
    perplexed, and no wonder. Then, as the Argument explains, "<i>a
    trumpet-call is heard</i>," and <i>Louise "bewildered</i>,"
    perhaps because it is the signal to go and dress for dinner,
    escapes to the palace; and <i>Louis</i>, feeling that the
    arbour is only a question of time, follows. Then Musketeers
    come off duty and get up an assault-at-arms, until their
    careful captain, afraid that they will hurt themselves with
    those nasty swords, orders them to stop, and the First
    <i>Tableau</i> is over.</p>

    <p>TABLEAU II.&mdash;Rich hangings have fallen close to the
    footlights, to represent an "Ante-room in the Palace."
    Attendants bring on two dressing-tables. Enter the two
    principal <i>danseuses</i>, who are about to dress for the
    Grand Ballet, when <i>Lulli</i>, the Composer, and
    <i>Prévot</i>, the <i>Maître de dance du Roi</i>, come in and
    very inconsiderately propose a rehearsal, which of course must
    be an <i>un</i>dress rehearsal&mdash;then and there. This not
    unnaturally puts both the ladies out of temper; they object to
    the ballet-skirts supplied by the Management as skimpy, and one
    of them throws up her part, which almost reduces <i>Lulli</i>
    to tears. The other undertakes it at a moment's notice,
    whereupon the first lady tries to scratch her eyes out, and
    then has a fit of hysterics. Both ladies have hysterics. A bell
    rings and, suddenly remembering that a Royal Ante-room is
    <i>rather</i> a public place to dress in, they catch up the
    ballet-skirts and flee, Attendants remove the dressing-tables.
    <i>Tableau</i> over. Plot where it was.</p>

    <p>TABLEAU III.&mdash;Grand Reception Room in the Palace. Enter
    the Queen, sulky, because <i>Louis</i> has taken all the Pages,
    and only left her a couple of Chamberlains. Enter <i>Louis</i>,
    more impudent than ever. They take their places on a
    <i>daïs</i>; the hangings at head of a flight of steps behind
    are withdrawn, and the first "Grand Ballet Divertissement"
    begins. <i>Louis</i> frankly bored, knowing there's another to
    come after that. Ballet charming, but he doesn't deign to
    glance at it, gives all his attention to a stuffed lamb on the
    top of the steps. Bevy after bevy of maidens disclosed behind
    hangings, each more bewitching and gorgeously attired than the
    last&mdash;but they don't interest <i>Louis</i>,&mdash;or else
    the presence of the Queen restrains him. Instructive to note
    the partiality of the <i>Corps de Ballet</i>. When Signorina DE
    SORTIS dances, they are so overcome that they lean backwards
    with outstretched arms in a sort of semi-swoon of delight. But
    the other lady may prance and whirl and run about on the points
    of her toes till she requires support, and they merely retire
    up and ignore her altogether. There is a dancing Signor in
    pearl grey, who supports first one Signorina and then the other
    with the strictest impartiality, and finally dances with both
    together, to show that he makes no distinctions and has no
    serious intentions. All this time <i>Louis</i> has been getting
    more and more restless; now and then he makes some remark,
    evidently disparaging, to the Queen, who receives it coldly.
    But at last he can't stand it any longer. "Call this dancing!
    <i>I'll</i> show 'em how to dance!" his look says. "Where's
    LOUISE?" And he gets up, pulls himself together, and invites
    her to come and dance a minuet. Queen disgusted with him, but
    pretends not to notice. <i>Louis</i> goes through minuet with
    extreme satisfaction to himself. Enter Page with an immense
    cushion, on which is "<i>a bracelet of great value</i>"
    (Argument again). Queen excited&mdash;thinks it's for
    <i>her</i>; but <i>Louis</i> stops the dance, takes the
    bracelet, and gives it to <i>Louise</i>. "A present from Paris.
    There, that's for being a good girl&mdash;take it, and say no
    more about it." She does, and they finish the minuet.
    <i>Louis</i>, on turning round to the <i>daïs</i>, discovers
    that the Queen has gone away, which he seems to think most
    unreasonable of her&mdash;just when he was dancing his very
    best! There is more ballet, after which the King discovers that
    <i>Louise</i> is missing too. Her Page comes on and hands him a
    letter, which he opens triumphantly. "A <i>rendezvous</i>, eh?
    Never knew jewellery fail yet! How I <i>am</i> carrying on, to
    be sure!" says his face. But, as he reads, his eyes begin to
    roll, and he has another attack of swelling. Then the curtains
    at the back are withdrawn again, and on the top of the steps,
    where the stuffed lambs were, he sees <i>Louise de
    Lavallière</i> in a nun's robe, entering a Convent.
    <i>Louis</i> can't believe it; he thinks it must be part of the
    performance, though not on the original programme. As he goes
    nearer to see, the curtains close, open again&mdash;and there
    is nothing. And the baffled monarch realises the melancholy
    truth&mdash;<i>Louise</i> has gone into a nunnery, without even
    returning the "bracelet of great value"! Whereupon the Act-drop
    mercifully falls, and veils his discomfiture. And that's
    all!</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH.&mdash;Several people who do not know me as
    the writer of the "Selections," have told me that they took the
    tip about "<i>Balmoral</i>" for the Manchester Cup, but backed
    it to <i>win</i> instead of to be <i>last</i>&mdash;thereby
    winning money!&mdash;now&mdash;of course the last thing a
    tipster wishes, is that his prophecy should turn out
    successful, therefore I am delighted at the result, as also was
    Sir MINTING BLOUNDELL, who won a good stake, and is the only
    person who knows the secret of my incognito. He congratulated
    me most heartily on my success, which he said was the more
    wonderful as he knew the owner did not much fancy the
    horse!&mdash;but, as I told him&mdash;if owners of race-horses
    knew as much as some of the public&mdash;(to say nothing of the
    prophets)&mdash;they would never lose the money they do, and
    would probably give up racing! The selection was entirely my
    own "fancy." I need scarcely say, I never <i>ask</i> an owner
    anything, and if he volunteers the information that he thinks
    his horse "has a good chance," I find as a rule, it's just as
    well to "let the horse run loose," as they put it; though that
    is an expression I never quite understood, as I've never yet
    seen a horse "run loose" in a race, except on one or two
    occasions when the jockey has been thrown at the
    start&mdash;which now I come to think of it, may be the origin
    of the expression!</p>

    <p>So Ascot is once more a departed glory! We all shivered on
    Tuesday, got roasted on Wednesday, were comfortable on
    Thursday, and resigned on Friday&mdash;and on the whole the
    toilette show was successful; though I fancy some of the best
    gowns were held over for Goodwood&mdash;<i>one</i> of mine was
    at all events&mdash;but my goodness!&mdash;if only our great
    grandmothers could have seen some of our modern
    petticoats!&mdash;more elaborate than any <i>dress</i> they
    ever saw!&mdash;but then, as Lord HARPER REDCLYFFE said, our
    great grandmothers never got off and on coaches with an
    admiring crowd looking on, as <i>we</i> have to do now-a-days;
    and you have to be pretty smart not to get hung up on the
    wheels&mdash;though as Lady HARRIETT ENTOUCAS said, "my dear
    Lady GAY&mdash;what <i>is</i> the use of wearing all this
    loveliness unless one&mdash;" but perhaps it will annoy her if
    I tell what she <i>did</i> say!</p>

    <p>The Royal Hunt Cup was a beautiful race, although the winner
    was not supposed to be the best of "JEWITT's lot;" but I am
    told he is one of those who "will not do his best at home,"
    being beaten in the trial&mdash;and after all, how <i>very</i>
    human that is&mdash;for how many men one knows who are perfect
    <i>bears</i> in their home circle!</p>

    <p>Of the horses I advised my readers to "Keep an eye on," only
    one, <i>Buccaneer</i>, put in an appearance, and won the Gold
    Cup; so that my warning as to the difficulty of doing this, was
    fully borne out by the result. My Gold Cup selection did not
    run, and had I known that <i>Ermak</i> would have been his sole
    opponent, I should have made him my tip; but I do not pretend
    to be Ermakulate! (That's <i>awful</i>&mdash;please forgive me,
    <i>dear Mr. Punch</i>!) From the way <i>St. Angelo</i> won the
    Palace Stakes, I can't help thinking he would have won the
    Derby but for the French horse <i>Rueil</i>, who tried to
    <i>eat him</i> during the race&mdash;(how shameful to let the
    poor thing get so hungry)&mdash;and this of course interfered
    with his chance&mdash;as you really cannot attend to two things
    at a time with a satisfactory result, unless they be sleeping
    and snoring!</p>

    <p>I presume that this sort of thing is meant when one reads in
    the sporting papers that such-and-such a horse was "nibbled
    at!"&mdash;but I really think that those who saw <i>St.
    Angelo</i> on Thursday, saw the winner of the Leger! There is
    no race of any special importance next week, either at Windsor
    or Sandown, but I will give my weekly tip for the probable last
    in the Windsor June Handicap, and meanwhile I may as well say
    that I shall grace with my presence the Newmarket July Meeting,
    and, emulating the example of other tipsters who send "Paddock
    Wires," I shall be happy to supply anyone with my
    two-horse-a-day "<i>Songs from the Birdcage</i>," at five
    guineas a-week&mdash;(a reduction to <i>owners</i>)&mdash;at
    which price my selections <i>must</i> be cheap.</p>

    <p>O SARAH B.! O Mr. ABBEY! What un-ABBEY thought induced you
    to select so dreary a play as <i>Pauline Blanchard</i>
    wherewith to weary the British Public? And what a finish!
    <i>Pauline</i>, all for the sake of her disappointed lover,
    kills her husband with a sickle!&mdash;a sickle-ly
    sight&mdash;and then reaps her reward. M. PERON, the Maire, was
    effective. Ancient <i>Angelina</i>, Mme. GILBERTE FLEURY,
    "fetched" everybody, and in her turn was fetched by M. FLEURY
    from a loft where stage-business had taken her in the previous
    Act, in order to receive her share of the plaudits. We hear
    that SARAH has accepted a One-Act piece called <i>Salammbô</i>,
    by OSCAR WILDE. Naturally we all see SARAH in the first part of
    <i>Sal</i>. Perhaps the "<i>ambo</i>" means SARAH and OSCAR.
    Being an Eastern subject, SARAH sees the chance in it of a
    Sara-scenic success. On Saturday last, with her wonderful <i>La
    Tosca</i> in the afternoon, and her <i>Dame aux Camélias</i>
    (the "O'Camélias" sounds like an Irish title) at night, SARAH
    regularly "knocked them" in the Shaftesbury Avenue. No one
    interested in dramatic art should miss seeing SARAH, at all
    events, in <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>PARTICULAR AND GENERAL RELATIONSHIP.&mdash;Mr. GEORGE
    CURZON, as the <i>Saturday Review</i> remarks in its notice of
    <i>Curzon's Persia</i>, "is not the first of his family who has
    written a good book of Eastern travel." The author, then, is
    not a first, but a second, or third CURZON, and this particular
    work of authorship creates a new kinship, as his travels are,
    now, related to the public.</p>

    <i>Her Tristan</i>; good, but not great. All vary well. As

    Don. With what an air he salutes <i>Zerlina</i>! The air is
    MOZART's "<i>La ci darem</i>," and therefore perfect. ZÉLIE DE

        (<i>From Miss Mary Logic to Miss Rosa Blackbord.</i>)
    </center>

    <p class="author"><i>Coached Cottage.</i></p>

    <p>MY DEAR ROSA,</p>

    <p>I fancy I told you that my Uncle JACK was coming home from
    sea. I had not seen him for six years&mdash;in fact he left
    England when I was a child of four or so. As you know, I am now
    ten. I naturally was rather curious to meet him. Well he is
    here, and I am fairly puzzled. He is rather a nice
    fellow&mdash;partly educated. He is distinctly shaky with his
    Classics, and has evidently forgotten half his Mathematics.
    However we got on pretty well. He seemed to be interested in my
    lecture upon Astronomy, and said "I seemed to be a hand at
    Chemistry." Well so I am. As you know, when I was a mere child
    I was always fond of experiments of an analytical character. He
    asked me if I had a doll, and I suppose he referred to the old
    lay-figure that I was wont to sketch before I took to studying
    from the nude. And now you will ask, why I am writing to you,
    when both you and I are so busy&mdash;when we are both
    preparing for matriculation? When we have so little spare time
    at our disposal?</p>

    <p>I will tell you. The fact is, he accuses me of ignorance in
    the biographical section of my studies. He gave me the history
    of a gentleman who used a blue dye for his moustache and
    murdered his wives with impunity. Then he related the
    adventures of a lady who slept for a hundred years from the
    wound of a spinning needle. I had to confess (although a
    constant reader of the <i>Lancet</i>) I had never heard of the
    case before. Then he recounted the adventures of a traveller
    who seems to have had a life of considerable interest. This
    person obtained quite a number of diamonds, with the assistance
    of a huge bird called a Roc. Then he had much to say about a
    dwarf who defeated (in really gallant style) several men of
    abnormally large stature. He laughed when I had to confess that
    I had never heard of these people before. He gave me their
    names. The wife-slaughterer was called <i>Bluebeard</i>; the
    lady who slumbered for a hundred years, <i>The Sleeping
    Beauty</i> (I suppose she preferred to keep her anonymity); the
    traveller's name was <i>Sindbad</i>, and the dwarf was <i>Jack
    the Giant-Killer</i>. Have you heard of any of these
    people?</p>

    <p>MY DEAR MARY,</p>

    <p>As you are many weeks my junior (to be precise, exactly two
    months), I hasten to answer your letter. I have searched all my
    Biographical Dictionaries, but cannot find the people of whom
    you are in search. As for myself, I have never heard of
    <i>Bluebeard</i>, know nothing of <i>The Sleeping Beauty</i>,
    and am sceptical of the existence of <i>Sindbad</i> and <i>Jack
    the Giant-Killer</i>. Like <i>Mrs. Prig</i>, who doubted the
    existence of <i>Mrs. Harris</i>, "I don't believe there were no
    such persons." By the way, you ought to read DICKENS. He is
    distinctly funny, and I can quite understand his amusing our
    grandmothers. I generally turn to his works after a long day
    with HOMER or EURIPIDES.</p>

    <p>"NE PLUS ULSTER."&mdash;Decidedly, Ulster can't go beyond
    "its last," or rather, its latest, most utter utterances. So
    far, "words, words, words;" but from words to blows there is a
    long interval, especially when their supply of breath having
    been considerably exhausted, there is not much to be feared
    from their "blows." However, so far, the men with Ulsterior
    views have been patted on the back by the <i>Times</i>, and
    "approbation from Sir HUBERT STANLEY is praise indeed." Yet,
    had the meeting been of Nationalists! "But," as Mr. KIPLING's
    phrase goes, "that is another story." For, from the
    <i>Times</i> leader-writer's point of view, "that in the
    Orangeman's but a choleric word which in the Nationalist is
    rank blasphemy." However, the steam is let off through the
    spout, and by the time the Nationalist's dream of Home Rule is
    realised, all efforts to the contrary on The part of gallant
    little Ulster will probably be "<i>Ulster vires</i>."</p>

    into the ear with the bellows three times a day. It may drive
    the wind back. For the "fulness, throbbing, &amp;c.," we should
    advise ramming a good-sized darning-needle as far as it will go
    into the orifice. After that&mdash;or even before&mdash;it
    might be best to consult a competent medical man.</p>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>Ye who have read in HOMER's mighty song</p>

            <p>How sage ULYSSES, AJAX towering strong,</p>

            <p>Met at the funeral games on Trojan sands,</p>

            <p>With knotted limbs and grip of sinewy hands,</p>

            <p>To wrestle for the prize, attend, draw near,</p>

            <p>And a new tale of coming tussle hear!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="stanza">
            <p>When great ACHILLES called them to the lists,</p>

            <p>Those men of massive thews and ponderous fists,</p>

            <p>"Scarce did the chief the vigorous strife
            propose,</p>

            <p>When tower-like AJAX and ULYSSES rose.</p>

            <p>Amid the ring each nervous rival stands</p>

            <p>Embracing rigid with implicit hands."</p>

            <p>Now Greek meets Greek again, but wrestling now</p>

            <p>Is not as on old Ilion's shore, I trow;</p>

            <p>Not now the olive crown, the long-wool'd sheep,</p>

            <p>Is prize; 'tis Power they strive to win and
            keep.</p>

            <p>By diverse dodges and by novel "chips,"</p>

            <p>Subtler "approaches," and more artful "grips,"</p>

            <p>The rival champions strive to lock and fell,</p>

            <p>Gallia's devices, found to answer well</p>

            <p>In wary onset and in finish slow,</p>

            <p>Old Attic swiftness, seen in hold and throw.</p>

            <p>Supplement or supplant. When AJAX stood</p>

            <p>Before ULYSSES, neither seemed in mood</p>

            <p>For long manoeuvring. To the clutch they came</p>

            <p>With sinews of snap-steel and souls of flame.</p>

            <p>"Close lock'd above, their heads and arm are
            mix'd;</p>

            <p>Below their planted feet at distance fix'd:</p>

            <p>Like two strong rafters, which the builder forms</p>

            <p>Proof to the wintry winds and howling storms;</p>

            <p>Their tops connected, but at wider space</p>

            <p>Fix'd on the centre stands their solid base."</p>

            <p>So in old days. Now wrestlers shift like snakes,</p>

            <p>And dodge <i>à la</i> DUBOIS, for mightier
            stakes</p>

            <p>Than olive, parsley, or the champion's belt</p>

            <p>Can furnish forth.</p>

            <p class="i10">Long time hath it been felt</p>

            <p>That two superior champions, age-long foes,</p>

            <p>At last must come to a conclusive close.</p>

            <p>"Defiled with honourable dust they roll,</p>

            <p>Still breathing strife, and unsubdued of soul;</p>

            <p>Again they rage, again to combat rise,"&mdash;</p>

            <p>For one must win; these cannot <i>share</i> the
            prize.</p>

            <p>Great GLADSTONIDES&mdash;place allow to
            age!&mdash;</p>

            <p>A chief of seasoned strength and generous rage,</p>

            <p>Fell, at their last encounter, to the skill</p>

            <p>Of him the swart of look, the stern of will,</p>

            <p>Broad-shouldered SALISBURION. Such defeat</p>

            <p>Valiant and vigorous veteran well might fret.</p>

            <p>He erst invincible, the Full of Days,</p>

            <p>The Grand Old One, full-fed with power and
            praise.</p>

            <p>ACHILLES-NESTOR, to no younger foe,</p>

            <p>Because of one chance slip and casual throw,</p>

            <p>The Champion's Belt is ready to resign;</p>

            <p>Nor may his foe the final fall decline.</p>

            <p>So "Greek meets Greek" in wrestling rig once
            more.</p>

            <p>Not AJAX or ULYSSES sly of yore,</p>

            <p>Nor modern STEAD MAN, JAMESON, or WEIGHT,</p>

            <p>Was e'er more eager for the sinewy fight.</p>

            <p>Much time is spent in "getting into grips."</p>

            <p>Mark how each wrestler crouches, feints, and
            slips!</p>

            <p>Mark how they circle round and round the ring,</p>

            <p>Like wary "pug," like tiger on the spring,</p>

            <p>Cautious as one, though as the other bold,</p>

            <p>Eye, foot, and hand manoeuvring for a hold!</p>

            <p>And when indeed they close in mutual clutch,</p>

            <p>And put the champion honours to the touch,</p>

            <p>Strain every muscle, try each latest "chip,"</p>

            <p>Which man shall first relax his sinewy grip,</p>

            <p>Be hiped, back-heeled, cross-buttocked, or bored
            down,&mdash;</p>

            <p>That's just the question that now stirs the
            town.</p>

            <p>The funeral games of a dead Parliament</p>

            <p>Bring every hero eager from his tent:</p>

            <p>Say, will ULYSSES, for his art renown'd,</p>

            <p>O'erturn the strength of AJAX on the ground?</p>

            <p>Or will the strength of AJAX overthrow</p>

            <p>The watchful caution of his artful foe?</p>

            <p>Will SALISBURION fairly hold his own,</p>

            <p>Or be by white-lock'd GLADSTONIDES thrown?</p>

            <p>All ask, all wonder much, but who may say?</p>

    <h2>SLY OLD SOCRATES!</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Fragment from the Very Newest "Republic."</i>)</h4>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>Thrasymachus-Shiptonides</i> (<i>after introducing a
        Deputation</i>). What we demand is a legal reduction of the
        hours of labour, and what we want of you, SOCRATES, is your
        invaluable aid in getting it.</p>

        <p><i>Socrates</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Most heartily do I
        wish you <i>may</i> get it&mdash;in both cases. But how say
        you; is the principle of permanence in a state or
        community, or class, best effected by harmony, or as it
        were, unity of action in all its members?</p>

        <p><i>All</i> (<i>after looking at each other, and rubbing
        their chins</i>). How not, SOCRATES?</p>

        <p><i>Socrates</i> (<i>rubbing his hands</i>). Entirely so!
        And your class then are unanimous in favour of a legal
        reduction of the hours of labour?</p>

        <p><i>Thrasymachus-Shiptonides</i> (<i>bothered</i>).
        Well&mdash;ahem!&mdash;hardly so, perhaps. But
        (<i>valiantly</i>), at least three-quarters of a million
        who met in the Park gathering at sixteen platforms, were
        substantially agreed.</p>

        <p><i>Socrates.</i> Humph! Over forty-six thousand to each
        platform. That's a far greater number than even <i>I</i>
        ever addressed. How did you count them, or ascertain their
        views?</p>

        <p><i>Thrasymachus-Shiptonides</i> (<i>flustered</i>).
        Well, I've had twenty years' experience of mob-mustering,
        and I think I <i>ought</i> to know.</p>

        <p><i>Polemarchus-Steadmanides.</i> But will you, SOCRATES,
        give us your opinions of the opinion of these
        three-quarters of a million.</p>

        <p><i>Socrates</i> (<i>laughing</i>). By Hercules! that
        were a task more tremendous than all his Labours.</p>

        <p><i>Cephalus-Pearsonides</i> (<i>aside</i>). By Vulcan,
        this is his wonted irony. He never inclines to answer a
        question forthrightly, but to use irony, or evasion, or
        what the Hibernians call "shenanigan," rather than answer,
        if anyone asks him anything.</p>

        <p><i>Thrasymachus-Shiptonides</i> (<i>aside, hastily</i>).
        Yes, yes! But you must not tell him that, here and now!</p>

        <p><i>Socrates</i> (<i>blandly</i>). Friends, as you
        suggest that the proceedings should be of a conversational
        or dialectical nature, a plan which falleth in with my
        views also, I will, if you please, catechise you
        categorically, so as to get further into the interior of
        the question, and of your&mdash;ahem!&mdash;minds.</p>

        <center>
            <i>Of this catechising, the reporter gives the
            following condensed summary.</i>
        </center>

        <p>Do you suggest that I should turn my back on myself?
        <i>No, that would be rude.</i> Or give myself away? <i>Nay,
        that were&mdash;unthrifty.</i> Can two solid things occupy
        the same space at the same time? <i>By Zeus, no!</i>
        Home-Rule&mdash;a <i>very</i> solid thing&mdash;fully
        occupies my mind&mdash;for the present. When a
        Gladstone-bag is <i>full</i>, can you put more into it?
        <i>By Mercury, no! But could you not reconsider the
        packing!</i> Not if the contents consist of <i>one</i>
        article only. You would like me to pack it with your Eight
        Hours' Bill? <i>Prodigiously! Your strong personality,
        would push forward even a worse thing.</i> How near are you
        to unanimity? <i>As near as considerable difference of
        opinion will allow us to come.</i> Is an unascertained
        minority to coerce an unwilling majority? <i>Our Council
        has not discussed that?</i> Do you know the relative
        proportions of majority and majority in organised and
        unorganised trades; how their respective opinions are to be
        ascertained, and, if ascertained, how legally enforced; if,
        and how, two millions and a half are to commit eleven
        millions to certain binding laws, and involve them in legal
        consequences? <i>No! Yes! Hardly! Not quite! More or less!
        Well, we're not quite sure, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i></p>

        <p><i>Socrates</i> (<i>smiling</i>). Now, tell me,
        THRASYMACHUS, is <i>this</i> the "harmony, or, as it were,
        unity of action," on which only, as we agreed, we could
        found "the principle of permanency in a state or
        community?"</p>

        <p><i>Thrasymachus-Shiptonides</i> (<i>hurriedly</i>).
        Well, what you say, SOCRATES, is very nice, and clear, and
        logical, and conclusive, in an argumentative sense, and
        your attitude is very noble and high-and-mighty&mdash;I
        mean highminded and all that. And we're <i>very</i>
        grateful&mdash;but deeply disappointed that you couldn't
        say something quite different&mdash;<i>in view of the
        General Election, you know!</i> (<i>Meaningly.</i>)</p>

        <p><i>Socrates</i> (<i>mildly, but firmly</i>). It is not
        my political duty to say pleasant things all round, but to
        ascertain&mdash;and tell&mdash;the Truth.</p>

        <p><i>All</i> (<i>deferentially</i>). Well, we are all
        <i>tremendously</i> thankful! (<i>aside</i>) for small
        mercies! Logic scores in argument, but votes tell at the
        poll. And if we do not run at least a hundred Labour
        Candidates to enlighten you as to our "unanimity," call
        us&mdash;items! [<i>Exeunt.</i></p>

    <p>Now didn't such a start in life as being educated
    "<i>previously</i>" to being "born," give Mr. COWELL a somewhat
    unfair advantage over the other competitors? Very few come into
    the world with such a chance. "Some are born great, some
    achieve greatness, and some have greatness thrust upon them,"
    says SHAKSPEARE. But to come into the world, like MINERVA,

    would have said, "Pro-di-gi-ous!"</p>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, June</i> 13.&mdash;House filled
    up in marvellous style to-night. Through all last week Benches
    nearly empty; the few Members present sunk in depths of
    depression. To-night, scene changed; Benches crowded; buzz of
    conversation testified to ill-repressed excitement. Mr. G.,
    amongst others, back in his place. "And looking uncommonly fit
    too," says FRANCIS GEORGE, Viscount BARING; "not at all sure he
    won't, after all, outlive Our JOE. At any rate, he's in fine
    condition for the little mill that's coming off."</p>

    <p>What everyone gathered to hear was Prince ARTHUR's views as
    to date of Dissolution. He has, up to now, successfully
    maintained attitude of absolute ignorance that Dissolution is
    even pending. Up to to-night the blessed word on everyone's
    tongue has not passed his lips. When, a fortnight ago, Mr. G.
    diplomatically approached topic, the Prince, with charmingly
    puzzled look, talked of something else. Nearest approach he can
    bring himself to make to topic, is to refer to arrangements of
    public business. This afternoon, when he stood at Table, a
    ringing cheer went up from serried hosts of Ministerialists;
    answered by closed-up ranks of Opposition. "Ha! ha!" said
    STUART, scenting the battle from afar, "that is the first
    challenge and reply in the great fight. Soon as BALFOUR's
    finished I shall take the Shoreditch 'bus, and look up my
    Constituents at Hoxton."</p>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR, with eyebrows slightly raised, stood waiting
    for opportunity to speak; evidently marvelling at this unwonted
    and unaccountable outburst of clamour. When it ceased, he
    observed, quite incidentally, that perhaps it would be
    convenient for him to make a statement "as to prospects of
    concluding business before termination of the Session." The
    Session, note. Not the life of Parliament, nor anything to do
    with so disturbing a thing as Dissolution. Kept this up through
    long business statement; only at conclusion accidentally
    stumbled on the word, and then regarded the prospect as so
    uninteresting and immaterial, that he could not come nearer to
    its contemplation than an interval of seven days. Not before
    the end of one week, and not after the middle of another, was
    as near as he thought it worth while to approach such trifling
    contingency.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;A great deal.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Quite touching to observe SQUIRE OF
    MALWOOD's friendly interest in progress of public Bills. GORST,
    in arranging business of Sitting, anxious not to appear too
    grasping, put down only limited number of Bills on Orders. "Why
    not put down all you've got?" the Squire asks, with mildly
    benevolent glance bent on Treasury Bench. "Supposing list is
    run through, there is end of your opportunity; whereas, if you
    put 'em all down you're ready to benefit by any accident, and
    may some night do wonderful stroke of business, working
    everything off."</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"

             MR. GLADSTONE has addressed
             a letter to the Press:&mdash;"SIR,&mdash;The requests
             addressed to me by Liberal friends ... for personal
             visits, speeches, and letters have at this juncture
             become so numerous that it is impossible to reply to
             them,... or to do more than to assure them that my
             time and thoughts are incessantly applied to the best
             mode I can devise to the promotion of our common
             cause."
    </div><span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"
       id="page312"></a>[pg 312]</span>

    <p>Prince ARTHUR listens attentively, regarding with
    questioning look the Grand Grey Figure on other side of Table.
    "When I was at school," he says, "we were taught, in a foreign
    tongue, a maxim about fearing the Greeks when they brought
    presents. Not quite sure the right Hon. Gentleman is chiefly
    concerned for interests of Government and advance of public
    business. But I'll consider his suggestion."</p>

             indignation."
    </div>

    <p>Business advancing by leaps and bounds; attendance small;
    Opposition effaced itself; only CLARK and ALPHEUS CLEOPHAS take
    objection to anything. Being in Committee of Supply they
    naturally want to know about things. The Squire privily
    approaches them in turn and entreats them to desist, which they
    regretfully do. Presently trouble breaks out in fresh quarter.
    FERGUSSON takes opportunity on Post Office Vote to ask
    Candidates at forthcoming Election to ignore appeal made to
    them by Telegraph Clerks for pledge to vote for Select
    Committee to inquire into working of Telegraph service. Says
    Mr. G. and Squire concur with him in his protest. This brings
    up GEORGE HOWELL, big with indignation at what he calls "a
    conspiracy against the Working Men of the country." HARRY
    LAWSON and STOREY join in. FERGUSSON sorry he spoke; didn't
    mean anything; Opposition mollified; vote agreed to.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Supply closed.</p>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. hurried in just now, a little
    late. Been these two hours at Carlton Gardens wrestling with
    representatives of the British workman on Eight Hours'
    Question. A little out of breath with skipping upstairs and
    running along corridor to be in time. Otherwise, as fresh as if
    his afternoon had been spent lounging on lawn at Dollis Hill,
    where the other night the Archbishop of CANTERBURY went to dine
    with him. Wants to know about the date of Dissolution. It will
    be convenient, he says, "at least, for those who have youth and
    vigour sufficient again to submit themselves to the
    constituencies." Mr. G.'s face wrinkled into smile as he
    uttered this witticism. House spontaneously burst into cheer as
    hearty on the Conservative side as with Opposition.</p>

    <p>Rattling on with business. SPEAKER out of breath with
    putting the question and declaring "the Ayes have it." Irish
    Education Bill not only passed Committee, but reported and read
    a Third Time. SEXTON sits content, having done good stroke of
    work in amending Bill. Managed affair with skill, address and
    indomitable perseverance. Resisted all temptation to make long
    speeches; pegged away at his Amendments, and carried the most
    important in teeth of the Ulstermen.</p>

    <p>"All very well," said DUNBAR BARTON, "JACKSON giving way to
    those fellows, and Prince ARTHUR saying, as TOOLE does on the
    House-boat, 'Oh, it's nothing!' It may be nothing to him, but
    it's a good deal to us. MACARTNEY and I have done our duty. For
    myself I shall say no more. I was christened DUNBAR BARTON.
    Henceforth let me be known as DUM BARTON."</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;More than ever.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Met BROOKFIELD in corridor just now.
    Capital fellow BROOKFIELD, though not very well known in House,
    much less to fame outside. Was in the 13th Hussars; is now
    promoted to the Lieutenant-Colonelcy of 1st Cinque Ports Rifle
    Volunteers. Has sat for Rye these seven years, but never yet
    spoke. This the more remarkable since he is a trained student
    of art of public speaking; has, indeed, just written profound
    treatise on the business. FISHER UNWIN sent me copy from
    Paternoster Square. Sat up all night reading it. The speech of
    "our worthy Member," proposing "The Town and Trade of X," is
    thrilling. Another, put into the mouth of "the youngest
    bachelor present," responding for "the Ladies," makes your
    flesh creep. BROOKFIELD's idea novel and ingenious. Sets forth
    what he calls a conventional speech. This fills up Column A. In
    Column B. he comments on it, rather severely sometimes; in
    Column C. throws out suggestions which, duly followed, make
    speech perfect. All possible occasions are dealt with, whether
    responding for Bishop and Clergy, Army, Navy, Reserve Forces,
    House of Commons, or House of Lords. BROOKFIELD, moreover, goes
    behind the scenes; shows the wretched man who has to make
    speech preparing it. You see him making up his mind what he has
    to say; jotting down a note; revising it after asking everyone
    he meets what he thinks of it. Then you write out your speech;
    learn it off; get up to address company; things swim before
    your eyes; tongue cleaves to roof of mouth; and you sit
    down.</p>

    </div>

    <p>Admirable book: useful on all occasions of daily life;
    invaluable on eve of General Election. Surprised to find
    BROOKFIELD looking miserably dejected. Tell him he ought to be
    quite otherwise. Explains that, fact is, means to catch
    SPEAKER's eye. Parliament can't last many more days; hasn't
    made maiden speech yet; must do it now, or never; Rye getting
    anxious. Could I give him a few hints? With great pleasure;
    full of the subject. Begin at the beginning. Ideas; memoranda;
    methods: (<i>a</i>) The arrangement of speech, (<i>b</i>) the
    management of the voice, (<i>c</i>) attitude or gesture. On
    this last I am very particular. "Holding up one finger," I say,
    "is a favourite way of bespeaking special attention to some
    'point' which you are trying to make; and waving the right
    hand, with outstretched arm, the forefinger leading, is an easy
    and not ungraceful method of illustrating the narrative portion
    of your speech. For the more vehement passages, a sudden
    flourish of the hand upwards, over your head, generally
    accompanies some aggressive, triumphant assertion, such as, 'I
    care not <i>who</i> he may be!' And a similar movement
    downwards, with both hands, would indicate some indignant
    complaint, such as, 'And <i>never</i>, from that day to this,
    have they fulfilled their promise.'"</p>

    <p>"Excellent!" cried LEVESON-GOWER, who, as I spoke,
    involuntarily waved the right hand, the forefinger leading.</p>

    <p>"Yes." said BROOKFIELD, looking a little more uneasy than
    before; "very clear, and to the point; but
    fancy&mdash;er&mdash;I've heard it before."</p>

    <p>"Of course you have," I said. "It's in your book; see page
    123. Mind you let me know when your speech in the House is
    coming off, After reading <i>The Speaker's A B C</i>, I
    wouldn't miss it for anything." <i>Business
    done.</i>&mdash;Dissolution postponed.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
